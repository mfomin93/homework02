## Mark's Portfolio Website

This repo contains html, css, and javascript files that make my portfolio website.

https://mfomin93.github.io/homework02/index.html

I created a Home Page, Contact, and Portfolio index file. These files all contained a navbar, jumbotron and footer.

I created a "Thank you" page after you fill the form out.

I've  optionally added a favicon of my headshot. 

Every clickable link is functional and should redirect to it's labeled page.

If you click the "Mark Fomin" in the top left corner, it takes you back to the home page.

The hamburger menu is functional when it is activated when you resize the window.
